# decisions/ — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Holds **why important design decisions were made**: why this option won among the reasonable alternatives.

- Admission (all four must hold): multiple reasonable options existed; long-term architectural impact; compatibility or maintenance cost; future readers will need to know why it was designed this way. Never for implementation details.
- Naming `ADR-NNNN-short-title.md` (lowercase kebab-case); numbers are unique and never reused; superseded ADRs are marked `Superseded` with a link to the successor — never rewritten to hide history.
- Required sections: Status, Date, Context, Decision, Alternatives Considered, Consequences, Related Documents; skeleton in [`.agent/templates/adr.md`](../../.agent/templates/adr.md).
